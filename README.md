Dictionary-Based Compression Tool (Linux Lab)
Supervised by Prof. Abdel Salam Sayyad
This project focuses on building a dictionary-based compression and decompression tool through shell scripting. It introduces a lossless technique to minimize file sizes by substituting patterns in text with shorter binary codes, based on a custom dictionary. Key features include 16-bit code assignment for up to 65,536 words, handling of Unicode characters, and special character recognition. The process encompasses checking for an existing dictionary, offering compression or decompression options, updating the dictionary with new words, and calculating compression ratios. This endeavor emphasizes the efficiency of data encoding and the practical application of scripting in data processing.
